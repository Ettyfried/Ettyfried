### Hi there, welcome in ðŸ‘‹
Please do indeed read me...

## Who am I?
Iâ€™m Etty. Iâ€™ve made this career switch to software engineering because Iâ€™m passionate about technology (and its future), and love everything about it.
Iâ€™ve won a scholarship to HyperionDevâ€™s coding bootcamp, and have just graduated - a thorough and intensely stimulating start to my tech career.
Iâ€™m a strong **analytical and creative thinker**, working to develop my skills, qualifications and experience in the tech industry. 
Iâ€™m a **fast learner**, with a **serious and positive** approach to work.

# My skills:
â€¢	Software development in Python and SQL 
â€¢	Object-oriented programming 
â€¢	Systems analysis
â€¢	Systems design 
â€¢	Source version control and GitHub 

â€¢	Analytical skills
â€¢	Effective communication and interpersonal skills
â€¢	Team working skills
â€¢	Problem solving
â€¢	Hard worker
â€¢	Creative and innovative

Iâ€™m particularly interested in an internship program so that I can study and work simultaneously, but am open any exciting opportunities develop my tech experience and expertise.

(Note: Before coding in all my spare time, I worked as a freelance graphic designer and content writer, and also play the piano. Now if you should happen to need a software engineer with those additional little features...:))
